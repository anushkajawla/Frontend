<p>Based on the current market trend, the research group is effectively focusing for 
developing IoT based solutions related to smart home, smart cities, energy metering, agriculture,
and health care etc. A separate IoT lab has been developed in the department that is equipped 
with sufficient number of embedded boards like ARM CORTEX, Arduino, Raspberry Pi boards 
etc with various sensors and actuators modules. The high speed LAN and Wi-Fi router are 
available for providing internet connectivity. The open source cloud platforms are utilized for 
data storage and analytics. The research group is also working in the area of Artificial 
Intelligence especially covering human recognition, gesture recognition and sentiment analysis.
Human recognition is one of the major concerns in surveillance and security systems in an IOT 
environment</p>
<U><h3><p><FONT COLOR="red" FACE="ARIAL">RF and Microwave Engineering</U></FONT>
</p></h3>
<p>RF and Microwave Engineering is a branch of Electronics and Communication Engineering 
that deals with devices, which are designed to operate in the radio frequency spectrum. 
Recently, there is an upsurge of research activities in this area. RF and Microwave 
Engineering group carries out research in the area of analysis and designing of Ultra 
wideband filters, Resonators, absorbers etc. The group is also engaged in the research and 
development of micro strip antennas, smart antennas, millimeter wave antennas, on chip 
antennas, SIW antennas, microwave antenna for biomedical applications.</p>
<U><h3><p><FONT COLOR="red" FACE="ARIAL">Semiconductor Device</p></h3></U></FONT>
<p>The objective of the Group's research is to create an ecosystem which leads to collaborative work 
in new technologies that enable advances in modern VLSI devices & circuits including device 
physics, materials and processes and low power IC design. The research group conducts studies 
on the electrical properties and characteristics of advanced nano-scale devices. The research 
undertaken within this group includes Modeling and Simulation of Semiconductor Devices, 
FETs Based Biosensors, Reliability Analysis for Semiconductor Devices, Modeling of FinFET 
parasitic capacitance, Delay modeling of digital circuit modules, Digital VLSI circuit design, 
VLSI device-circuit co-design, SOI MOSFET (FDSOI & PDSOI) and their circuit applications 
in SRAM memories and ultra low power digital Circuit Design, synthesis, characterization and 
fabrication of various organic and inorganic materials based electronic devices, and fabrication 
of devices using various thin film deposition techniques</p>
